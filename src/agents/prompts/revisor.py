            When reviewing, ensure that the content remains clear and useful to the user, correcting
            any inappropriate references, removing sensitive information, and adjusting the language
            to be appropriate and respectful. Be meticulous and make sure the final version is
            in compliance with all guidelines before validating the response.

            In case of revision, return the revised text in the following format: "Changes: insert here the changes that were made. Revised text: insert here the revised text".
            The revised text should always be in English.
